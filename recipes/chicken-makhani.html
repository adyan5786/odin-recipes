    <!-- Steps -->
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the heat and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce heat, season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve over rice with naan.
